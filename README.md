##   Residence Life Dashboard (Staff Management System)

This project implements a dynamic University Residence Management System. It manages rooms, residents, maintenance requests, and events. The "Residence Life" dashboard has been meticulously crafted to meet the needs of a positive living experience for students, providing university staff with an all-in-one tool to track, analyse, and enhance the residential living activities of students. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The dashboard offers visualisations and reports that help staff identify trends, assess program effectiveness, and make data-driven decisions to improve the living experience.

# University Residence Management Dashboard



## Project Overview

The University Residence Dashboard is a comprehensive web application designed to manage various aspects of university residence life. It includes features for managing events, handling student information, monitoring room status, and scheduling maintenance activities. The dashboard provides an intuitive user interface with a header for search and notifications, a sidebar for navigation, and a main content area for detailed interactions.


## Key Features

    Utilize charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent residence data like occupancy rates, room types, and maintenance requests.
    

- Room Management

    Display a list of rooms with details like resident information, room status (occupied, vacant, under maintenance), and basic amenities.

- Maintenance Requests
    Provide a section to view and manage maintenance requests submitted by residents.
- Alerts and Notifications
    Display important alerts and notifications for staff, such as upcoming room inspections, maintenance deadlines, or urgent resident requests.
- Theme Switcher
    Implement a feature that allows staff to switch between different themes (light/dark or custom colors) using browser storage (cookies or local storage).

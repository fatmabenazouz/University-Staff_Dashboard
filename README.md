Technical Choices and Rationale
 Technology Stack
 Frontend: React.js
Rationale: React.js provides a robust, flexible framework for building interactive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture allows for reusable U.I. components and efficient updates, which is crucial for creating a responsive and dynamic dashboard.
 Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Rationale: Node.js, paired with Express.js, offers a high-performance, scalable backend environment. This stack is ideal for handling real-time data processing and API requests, ensuring smooth and efficient data management.

Usage Instructions for Dashboard Functionalities
 1. Navigating the Dashboard
Home Screen: Upon logging in, users are directed to the Home Screen, which provides an overview of key metrics, recent activities, and notifications. Use the navigation bar on the left to access different sections of the dashboard.
Search and Filter: Use the search bar at the top right to quickly locate specific data or reports. Filters can be applied to narrow down results based on criteria such as date range, activity type, or resident.
 2. Real-Time Activity Tracking
Viewing Activities: Navigate to the "Room Tracker" section for real-time updates on student activities, maintenance requests, and events. Activities are displayed in a timeline format, with options to filter by type or date.
Adding a New Activity: Click the “Add" button to log new events or requests. Fill out the required fields, including activity type, description, and relevant details. Save the entry to update the timeline.
 3. Enhanced Communication Tools
Setting Up Alerts: In the “Alerts" section, configure notifications for specific events or conditions. Set thresholds and preferences to receive timely updates about important activities.
 4. User Settings
Profile Management: Go to the “Profile" section to update personal information, change your password, or adjust notification preferences.
System Preferences: Customize dashboard settings, such as theme and layout, to suit your preferences. Access the “Settings" menu to make adjustments.

Challenges faced in the creation of the Dashboard
 Lack of contributions: We faced significant issues in building my project dashboard due to the need for donations from group members. With everyone's input, we encountered complete data and needed more information, which led to an incomplete view of the project's status and performance. This delayed progress, as critical updates and tasks must be shared promptly, hindered decision-making and overall project advancement. Additionally, inconsistent contributions exacerbated alignment and coordination issues, as team members had differing understandings of project goals and metrics. Over time, this lack of contribution harmed team morale and trust, creating perceptions of unequal effort and commitment and negatively impacting our collaboration and teamwork. Due to some group members deciding not to work on the project, the weight was left to others to try to deliver a functioning and responsive website.
 Understanding the implementation of unique features: Understanding and implementing special features, like a theme switcher, posed a significant challenge when building my project dashboard. We had to ensure the theme switcher was integrated seamlessly, maintaining consistency and functionality across all components. This required deciding on appealing themes, managing persistent state changes, and ensuring compatibility with various devices. Additionally, we had to update and refactor existing code without disrupting current functionalities. This process highlighted the need for advanced technical skills and attention to detail, making it a significant hurdle during my project's development.
